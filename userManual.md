# MY STYLE
---------------------------------------------------------------
I'm easy-going and hard-working. I want to contribute to every project and team I work with. I always stay practical and simple in the way I tackle my duties.



---------------------------------------------------------------
# MY VALUES
---------------------------------------------------------------
## *Truth.*

Please, make me see the truth about something. I'll accept it if you convince me, even if it hurts. I realize that truth isn't always clear, but we can work with what we have.


## *Trust.*

I have your back if you have my back. I like being able to rely on someone; in turn, I try to be as reliable a person as I can.


## *Clarity.*

I need to understand. Please explain, please show. I also try to be clear so ask me questions if you need to.

## *Simplicity.*

I'm not lazy, but I like to make my life as easy as possible. Streamlining is an important practice for every aspect of my life.

---------------------------------------------------------------
# WHEN TO APPROACH ME:
---------------------------------------------------------------
## *Anytime, but be respectful of my time.*

I don't mind being approached, even for a quick chit-chat. I especially enjoy setting my work aside if it means helping someone else for a few moments. I do like control over my time, so please be mindful of it.

## *Maybe not outside of work, if its work-related.*

I like my free time to focus on myself, family, and friends. I'm fine with being reached out outside of work, but I might not get back to you immediately if it's work-related.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW BEST TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME:
---------------------------------------------------------------

## *Straightforwardness.*

Say what you need to say. No need to dress up anything.

## *Don't be vague.*

I appreciate clarity, so I might ask a lot of questions just to make sure I know exactly where we stand. I like it when we are on the same page. I need to know exactly what you expect from me, and I want you to know exactly what I expect from you.

## *Courtesy.*

Kindness and politeness is always appreciated.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW I MAKE DECISIONS:
---------------------------------------------------------------

## *Logically.*

I don't often factor in emotions when making decisions. I'm more convinced by objective reasoning. I find the solution that is logically better for the situation.



---------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT ME:
---------------------------------------------------------------

## *Don't think I'm unapproachable. I'm quite social.*

To be honest, I won't be good with small-talk. But, just talk to me normally; I'm already your friend. I do like talking and connecting with people.


---------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO HELP ME:
---------------------------------------------------------------

## *Keep judgment to a minimum.**

\*This doesn't mean I can't take criticism.* I just feel more comfortable in an environment where everyone is allowed to share themselves and their thoughts without being harshly judged or punished for it. Think freely and openly - say your mind, and let me say mine.




## *Let's be friends.*

Promote a peaceful environment we can all enjoy and get along in. Let's be kind and mindful of each other.
